      <h2>Hi, I'm Justin. I'm a full stack web developer (in training)</h2>
      <div class="project">
        <p>I'm a web developer apprentice focused on HTML, CSS and jQuery, sprinkled with a little bit of ASP Classic and SQL. 
          <br>I love web development because it's the answer to a myriad of problems in the world, with a little bit of tailoring of course.
          Building solutions for these problems brings satisfaction rivaled only with the placement of the last piece in a jigsaw puzzle.
          I've taken this coding journey solo for quite some time and I'm thirsty to contribute and be challenged by a team of great developers.
          <br>If I'm not found behind a keyboard, I'm probably throwing a frisbee, maybe trying out a new restaurant in town, or quite possibly on a plane to a explore a new country. </p>

        <h3>Lord of the Rings Quiz </h3>
        <p>This is for LOTR fans of all ages. How well do you know the Lord of the Rings movie Trilogy? Test your knowledge with some trivia questions that
          span across all three movies. This was inspired in a conversation with a friend being quizzed on our knowledge of the movies.

        <h3>Findr</h3>
        <p>Event Findr is a project that hones in on third party API integration. It connects with the TicketMaster and
          APIXU Weather APIs. How many times have you had a free Friday night and no novel ideas were coming to mind? This app is for you.
          <br>Event Findr gives the user the ability to search for events located by city or zip code and the weather for the current day of search.
          <br>Never again be plagued by sitting at home with no plans over the weekend!
